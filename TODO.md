### Critical:
- [ ] Figure out why IMU does not give readings in correct frame
- [ ] Fix inertial_calc so it considers Ixy, Ixz, etc. during movement calculations (and other TODOs)
- [ ] Add in inertial with motors as well
- [ ] Proper namespaces and parameters for gazebo models and plugins

### Additional
- [ ] Add in config files for all nodes (where needed)

### Quality of Life:
- [ ] Create a single launch file to make starting easier

### Documentation
